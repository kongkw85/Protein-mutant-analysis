Computational analysis of protein mutants
Performed computational analysis of Target Protein and its point mutant: sequences from UniProt, structures predicted with AlphaFold, aligned in PyMOL, stability changes assessed with DynaMut2, interface properties with PDBePISA, and binding affinity with mCSM-PPI2 to evaluate mutation effects.

Retrieved sequences of Target Protein and ligand from UniProt.

Introduced point mutation in silico.

Predicted structures of WT and mutant proteins, as well as their complexes with ubiquitin, using AlphaFold.

Aligned WT and mutant in PyMOL to assess structural differences and compute RMSD.

Evaluated stability changes with DynaMut2.

Analyzed ΔG dissociation, interface solvation energy, and buried surface area using PISA.

Assessed changes in binding affinity with mCSM-PPI2.

This workflow provides a systematic approach to assess structural and energetic impacts of point mutations on protein-protein interactions.
