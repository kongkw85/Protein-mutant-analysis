Computational analysis of protein mutants
Performed computational analysis of Target Protein and its point mutant: sequences from UniProt, structures predicted with AlphaFold, aligned in PyMOL, stability changes assessed with DynaMut2, interface properties with PDBePISA, and binding affinity with mCSM-PPI2 to evaluate mutation effects.
